### Description

I have seen many submissions on how to Hide/show windows functions but they werent all written very well or they were "overcoded". This code is very easy to understand and easy to incorporate into your project. I havent commented it very much but it doesnt need it really.I can comment it heavily if you'd like me too and re-send the code to you.Please E-mail me if this is the case. I also didnt consolidate the module's for the reason that its hard for a new coder to discriminate beetween neccessary declarations for there function's. I know this would helped me when I was starting out.Please vote and Enjoy-
